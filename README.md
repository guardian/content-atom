# Content Atom Model Definition

This is the Thrift definition of the Content Atom model, and the published
versions of this repository are built from the autogenerated code in various
languages.

## Adding a new atom type

In order for the scala code generated from the thrift definitions to be packaged correctly a scala namespace needs to be included. For example for the chart atom this would be:
`#@namespace scala com.gu.contentatom.thrift.atom.chart`

## How to release

```
$ sbt 'release cross'
```

This will release 3 artifacts to Maven Central:

* `content-atom-model-thrift-$version.jar` contains only the Thrift files
* `content-atom-model_2.11-$version.jar` contains the Thrift files and Scrooge-generated Scala 2.11 classes
* `content-atom-model_2.12-$version.jar` contains the Thrift files and Scrooge-generated Scala 2.12 classes

You will need a PGP key and Sonatype credentials. See [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Using-Sonatype.html) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_MiE8qntdDn97QIRnIUci5wdVQ8_defCqpeAwoKY8g/edit#heading=h.r815791vmxv5) for some helpful guides.

To cross release locally use

```
$ sbt '+publishLocal'
```

### JavaScript

The JS library should be published to npmjs, see:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/publish

and `npm help publish`.

If you're unfamiliar with publishing on npm the following commands can be useful:

* `npm whoami` - to find out your username (if you have created one)
* `npm adduser` - to create a user
* `npm owner ls` - to check the owners of content-atom.
* `npm owner add <username>` - to add a new owner allowing them to publish content-atom.

But in summary:

1. Bump the version number in `package.json`

2. Make sure you have built the latest version of the JS library with `sbt compile`

3. If you've added another type, be sure to add it to `js/main.js`

4. Then, `npm publish` in the same directory as `package.json`

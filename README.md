# Content Atom Model Definition

This is the Thrift definition of the Content Atom model, and the published versions of this repository are built from the autogenerated code in various languages.

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.gu/content-atom-model-thrift/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.gu/content-atom-model-thrift)

## Adding a new atom type

In order for the scala code generated from the thrift definitions to be packaged correctly a scala namespace needs to be included. For example for the chart atom this would be:
`#@namespace scala com.gu.contentatom.thrift.atom.chart`

## How to release

Prior to releasing, you will need to ensure that:
 - `tsc` is installed on your machine (e.g. `brew install typescript`)
 - `npm` is installed on your machine
 - you have an NPM account which is part of the [@guardian](https://www.npmjs.com/org/guardian) org
 - you have configured an NPM [access token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens) to 
   publish to @guardian; a convenient way to set this up is to execute `npm login` locally and follow the prompts;
   this will create/append to an `~/.npmrc` file with the sufficient config
 - you have the followed the [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNXjoZDqZMsQblOVXPAIIOMWuwUKe3KzTCttuqS7AcY/edit)
   for publishing to Maven and Sonatype
   
To release to Maven Central:
```sbtshell
release cross
```
This will release these artifacts:
- `content-atom-model-thrift-$version.jar` contains only the Thrift files
- `content-atom-model_2.13-$version.jar` contains the Thrift files and Scrooge-generated Scala 2.13 classes
- `content-atom-model_2.12-$version.jar` contains the Thrift files and Scrooge-generated Scala 2.12 classes

Note that support for scala 2.11 ended with scrooge 21.3, so we won't output
- `content-atom-model_2.11-$version.jar`
any more.

To release to NPM:
```sbtshell
project typescriptClasses
releaseNpm <version released to Maven>
```

If you need to make a candidate release build available for testing elsewhere, start sbt with
```
$ sbt -DRELEASE_TYPE=candidate
```
then follow the above release steps as usual. You'll be prompted that this is a CANDIDATE release
and for a version number that looks like 1.2.3-RCn where n is the candidate build number
you'll specify. This isn't really tracked so make sure it's a new build by checking Maven and NPM first.

When releasing to NPM for typescript, you'll have to manually type the version number to match what you 
released to Sonatype/Maven for Scala.

To cross release locally use
```
$ sbt '+publishLocal'
```
